import { Logo } from '@/src/components/site/Logo';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Introducing the blog',
  description:
    'A Spotlight-style MDX blog inside our Next app: local files, clean templates, and fast iteration.',
  date: '2025-12-14',
  tags: ['product', 'engineering', 'mdx'],
  image: '/logo.svg',
  authors: [{ name: 'Template team' }],
};

This blog is built from plain `.mdx` files inside the repo — no external CMS. That means writing is as easy as creating a new file, and shipping is as easy as merging a PR.

<div className="mt-6 flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-border/50 bg-surface/20 p-8">
  <Logo size="10xl" label="Logo mark" />
</div>

## What you get

- A `/blog` index with a featured post, tags, and search.
- A `/blog/[slug]` post page with good typography and MDX components.
- `/blog/tags` and `/blog/tags/[tag]` for browsing by topic.
- RSS + sitemap + robots so it behaves like a real blog.

## MDX is code (when you need it)

Because this is MDX, you can embed small UI bits when it actually helps.

```ts
export const meta = {
  title: 'My post',
  date: '2025-12-14',
  tags: ['notes'],
}
```

## A practical writing workflow

Write the post. Add `meta`. Push. Done.
