Search is most useful when it feels instant. For this blog we generate an index at build time, so the UI can search locally without round-trips.

## What gets indexed

We index headings and paragraphs so results are meaningful and deep-linkable.

## Keeping posts clean

We avoid using a top-level markdown horizontal rule so our changelog-specific MDX wrapping logic does not kick in for blog posts.

## Minimal API surface

The index exposes a single `search(query)` function that returns hits with URLs and titles.
